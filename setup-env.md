# Privy Environment Setup Instructions

## 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following content:

```bash
# Privy Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=cmdfr67ty007dl10mre188aw1
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your-privy-app-secret-here
```

## 2. Replace the Secret

Replace `your-privy-app-secret-here` with your actual Privy app secret from the Privy dashboard.

## 3. Security Notes

- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is already gitignored - your secrets won't be committed
- ‚úÖ `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` is safe to expose to the client
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` is server-only - never expose this in client code
- üîÑ Restart your dev server after creating the file

## 4. Verification

After setting up the environment file, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Privy wallet connection should now work properly with your app ID and secret.

## 5. What's Been Implemented

‚úÖ **Privy Integration Complete:**
- PrivyProvider wrapper with your app ID
